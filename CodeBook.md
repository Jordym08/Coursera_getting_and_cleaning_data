#Features
The features in this table are required with the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S2.
A group of 30 volunteers within the age of 19-48 years performed six activities (waling, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing and laying).

The signals which came from the Samsung Galaxy S2 were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Features:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag


Feature Vector variables unclude:

mean() : 		mean values of multiple measurements of the original variables.
std(): 		Standard deviation of multiple measurements of the original variables.
activity_id: 	Identifier, identifying the activity of each subject
activity_name: 	Descriptive name of each subject's activity
subject_id :	Identifier, identifying each subject
